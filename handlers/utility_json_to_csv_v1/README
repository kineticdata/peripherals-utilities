=== Detailed Description
This handler makes some assumptions about the format of the JSON structure.  It
expects an array of objects to be the value of the root of the JSON object.  In
the example below the root object has a label of "table", this label is
arbitrary and unused by the handler.  This handler also expects the array of
objects to contain only simple objects, not nested arrays or nested objects.

=== Examples
Below is an example of a JSON input string and the corresponding CSV output
generated by this handler.
