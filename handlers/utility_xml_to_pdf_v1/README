## Detailed Description
  This handler generates a PDF file based on inputs.  It can include an image attachment from an existing submission.
  The PDF file is uploaded to the Kinetic Platform Filestore and the output is the reference to the file.  A second
  handler or routine (e.g., Kinetic Submission Update) should be used to update an attachment field with the output
  from this handler.
